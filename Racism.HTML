<ul>
  <li>Denying a person his or her fundamental rights due to their ehnicity</li>
  <li>Unlawfullyn dugding a person due to racial stereotypes</li>

  as we are one in this world regardless of our skin colour or ethnicity and the contribution
of people from diverse societies and cultures can make the world a better place(that sounded
